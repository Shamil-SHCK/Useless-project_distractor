### Project Description
Procrasti-Timer is a satirical web application that masquerades as a productivity timer but is scientifically designed to sabotage your focus. It helps users achieve maximum distraction by redirecting them to a random time-wasting website when they least expect it, thereby preserving a healthy work-distraction balance.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today's "hustle culture," workers are dangerously close to achieving their goals. Uninterrupted focus leads to completed tasks, which in turn leads to a terrifying sense of accomplishment. This epidemic of productivity leaves no room for spontaneous Wikipedia deep-dives or discovering new, useless websites.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Procrasti-Timer introduces **Intentional Interruption‚Ñ¢** into your workflow. By setting a focus timer, you are actually setting a time bomb of distraction. Our proprietary algorithm ensures you are redirected to a random, useless website at the most inconvenient moment, saving you from the horrors of efficiency.
